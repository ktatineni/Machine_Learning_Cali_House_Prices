# Machine_Learning_Cali_House_Prices

I have built a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. 
This data has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price for each block in California. 
Blocks are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes census data. 


THE MODEL PREDICTS THE MEDIAN HOUSING PRICE IN ANY GIVEN DISTRICT, GIVEN THE METRICS.
